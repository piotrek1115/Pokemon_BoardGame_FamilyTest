// Phase 3 rule switches (docs/PHASE_3_POST_PLAYTEST_REDESIGN.md).
//
// Every rule Phase 3A changes sits behind one switch in CONFIG.rules. A game
// keeps the switches it was created with (they live in state.config), so a game
// started before a change plays on exactly as it began. Saves from before Phase
// 3 (schema 12) are migrated to the 'phase2' ruleset below: the Phase 2 game,
// byte for byte. The simulator's Phase 2 baseline uses the same ruleset
// (`npm run simulate -- --rules phase2`).
//
// Each 3A slice that implements a rule adds its value to SUPPORTED and flips
// the switch in CONFIG.rules for new games; PHASE2_RULES never changes.
//
// Gameplay P1 (schema 15; DQ-89…95) adds seven switches, the wild-encounter
// slice (09.10.2026) an eighth: wildTemperament. Every save made
// before schema 15 — a Phase 2 game or a Build 2 game — gets them at their old
// values (P1_OFF) when it loads, so it plays on exactly as it began; only new
// games get Gameplay P1.
//
// Phase 3B Macro 01 (10.10.2026, after the Build 3.0 family playtest) adds five
// switches — pokeStops, oakJobs, oakKit, catchDice, explorePools. A Build 3.0
// save (schema 16) has none of them: it gets their old values (M01_OFF, the
// same as PHASE2_RULES) when it loads and plays on exactly as it began; only
// new games get Macro 01. No schema bump: the new state (Oak's jobs, the
// emergency kit) exists only in games created with the switches on.
//
// Playtest 004 (11.10.2026, after the family's Build 3.1 game) adds two switches
// — evolutionGrowth, leadPick — and a third value of growthFainted ('battle').
// A Build 3.1 save has none of the new switches and growthFainted false: it
// gets PT4_OFF when it loads and plays on exactly as it began (its thresholds,
// its Growth, no lead pick); only new games get Playtest 004. No schema bump.
//
// Phase 3B Macro 02 slice M02-1 (12.10.2026) adds one switch — localPools ('v2'
// explicit per-place pools with the signature guarantee). An older save gets
// M021_OFF (biome pools). Content is NOT versioned (Piotr, 12.10 10:28: every
// family test starts a new game): the 55 new species are in every game's
// biome pools and trainer teams too, so an older save plays on with them.
// No schema bump.
//
// Slice M02-2 (12.10.2026) adds one switch — fatigue (exploration fatigue per
// player × place, engine/fatigueEngine.js) — and new games turn Vigilance off:
// fatigue takes its Catch Die step (§6.6). An older save has no fatigue switch
// and gets false; its Vigilance stays what it stored. No schema bump: the
// counters exist only in games created with the switch on.
//
// Build 3.3 (PLAYTEST_005, docs/BUILD_3_3_SPEC.md; Piotr's decisions 13.10.2026)
// adds switches slice by slice; every one is off in an older save (B33_OFF), so a
// Build 3.2 game plays on exactly as it began. Stage 1 (B33-1 combat):
// battleTempo ('v2': a healing item in battle costs the exchange and the
// opponent answers — no per-Pokémon cap, DEC-16 B), rocketMeowth ('always':
// Meowth fights with Jessie and James in every Rocket battle, DEC-15 M1),
// initiative ('fsB': First Strike „Szybkie wejście”, DEC-12). Stage 2 (A1
// sandbox foundations): starts ('character': Ash / Gary Pallet, Brock Pewter,
// Misty Cerulean), hometownGym (Brock's / Misty's first badge elsewhere — the
// gymUnlock credential), travelGraph ('v2': mission routing through the one
// effective graph, AUD-03). Stage 3 (B33-3): gymChallenge ('v2': a gym is a
// chain of gym trainer(s) → leader in one challenge, CONFIG.gyms.chainTrainers
// PROVISIONAL) and leagueChallenge ('v2': Lorelei → Bruno → Agatha → Lance, a
// full reset on a loss or exit, the ribbon never skips). Stage 4: rest 'v3'
// (Rest +2 on one chosen non-fainted Pokémon, 1 action; Build 3.2 keeps 'v2' = +1 —
// the value every Build 3.2 save stores). Correction batch (13.10): growthCredits
// (a gym / League opponent pays its Growth once per player, across attempts —
// no farming through resets). No schema bump.

// Every switch at the value the game had before Phase 3A.
