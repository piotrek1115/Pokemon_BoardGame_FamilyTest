// a backpack to give back, a lost trainer, strange tracks, a bully on the road, a hidden stash, a resident's
// rumour (the Rumours layer). Two small new effects: item {item, amount} and rumour (hear one open opportunity).
// Not every one ends in a battle; every reward is small and comes from an Explore (fatigue-limited) — no farm,
// no softlock (each has a „walk on” choice or no cost). Without the switch the draw is exactly as before.
