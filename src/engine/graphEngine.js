// incidents and persistent blockers (Snorlax, Cut — later slices) join HERE, in
// `worldBlocks`, never in a second movement system.

// (turnEngine), the AI's distances and its BFS, mission destinations and mission
// distance (questEngine, with rules.travelGraph 'v2'), the board's highlights
// (table/board.js). The board's geometry is never changed here.
